# Rock-Classification-ML-Models

This project focuses on classifying different types of rocks using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training to achieve accurate classification. The dataset is analyzed using pandas and visualized with seaborn. Various machine learning models are implemented and evaluated to determine the best-performing approach.

## The notebook includes:

### Data preprocessing: 
Cleaning and structuring the dataset for optimal model performance.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to understand relationships between attributes.
### Feature Engineering & Data Splitting: 
Identifying continuous and categorical attributes, handling missing values, and selecting a representative test set.
### Linear Regression & Regularization:
Implementing Linear Regression using both the Normal Equation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
Exploring Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization to understand the impact of penalty terms.
Evaluating the effect of hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size.
### Polynomial Regression: 
Extending linear regression with polynomial features to assess underfitting and overfitting.
### Model Evaluation & Predictions: 
Using appropriate metrics to compare models and discussing potential improvements.
